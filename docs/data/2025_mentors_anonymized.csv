4,Full-Time Student,"Hey y'all!
I'm a second-year full-time student here in the DSAN program. I'm from a small town in Arkansas (shoutout Walmart). I'm quite an extroverted person both in and out of class, and you'll definitely see me floating throughout the year. A fun fact about me is that I grew up with 4 siblings on a farm, so that cultivated into a loud and outgoing personality ;P. I have many hobbies outside of the program, like fitness, public speaking, fashion, hiking, music, clubbing, activism, reading, and trivia. My work inside the program typically deals with data science for social good; more specifically, how we can be more inclusive with the fairness algorithms we build. I'm hoping to pursue a PhD in computational social science with an emphasis on policy analysis. If I don't end up being your mentor, I'm always down to grab a coffee or work at a cafe together!

41,Full-Time Student,"Hello! I’m a rising second year student in the DSAN program where my primary goal is to learn as much as possible about data science with the aim of applying it to the field of education. My experience primarily lies in education - I worked with AmeriCorps Jumpstart while I was an undergraduate here at Georgetown and then taught kindergarten in NYC for a year and a half after graduating.

I know that starting a new graduate program comes with a large learning curve – especially if you come from a non-computer science focused background like me. My goal as your mentor is to not only support you with any questions you may have either about the program or about internships, but also to help you dive into the wonderful community we have here in the DSAN program. I look forward to working with you all this upcoming year! ",Psychology (Minor in Statistics),Yes,"Statistics Intern: Base Operations, August 2022 - December 2022
